# CSS Positioning

In CSS, there are a few ways that you can "position" an element on a webpage. Ideally, everything should be fluid and responsive. However, there will be times when you will need to change _how_ an element is positioned on a page. By default, elements are always `position: static` but there are a few other options: `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`.

As of now, `position: sticky` has [little support](https://code.visualstudio.com/) amoung the browsers. But, you can still use these experimental features via browser prefixes. 

## Assignment
Below is a wireframe of some chat buddles that you will need to recreate. Leveraging your HTML and CSS stills to date, use the various positionings to achieve the design provided.

You will have a series of chat buddles (the text could be anything you want), each of which will have a name above it _and_ a date timestamp displayed in the right corner. For the sidebar, list the participants in the "chat" with a name and image.

This assignment is designed to have you use `relative`, `absolute`, and `sticky` positioning. By the end of this assignment, you should have a general idea of what each type of positioning does. Positioning can be a difficult concept to grasp, hence why this assignment isn't HTML and CSS heavy (other than positioning of course...).

Below is a `.mov` of what you should expect the final product to be. In addition, a wireframe is provided for you to reference.

## Requirements

When complete, you should have _two_ files in your repo:

- `index.html`
- `reset.css`
- `styles.css`

As usual, your webpage should have a `title` and `description` as well as an external stylesheet for your custom styles.

> NOTE: Be sure to add comments in your code for organization and notes to future developers!
